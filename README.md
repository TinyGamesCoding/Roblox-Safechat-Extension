# Roblox Safechat Extension
A Google Chrome extension that brings the safechat to (mostly) all text boxes, by right clicking.

This was just a pretty short project I made for fun!
If you want to upload this to the chrome web store, and I haven't already, just please give me credit! ([@Tiny_Games](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZSyZ9F4KcVjpWTwpfFoxNw))

## INSTALLATION

1. Download the source code, by clicking on the green button.
2. Unzip the file after it downloads.
3. Open up chrome, and go to chrome://extensions/.
4. Enable Developer Tools, there should be a button in the top right corner.
5. Click on the "Load Unpacked" button.
6. Select the folder that contains all the files, like manifest.json.
7. You should be all done now! You can turn off the Developer Tools, and you can ask me for help.
